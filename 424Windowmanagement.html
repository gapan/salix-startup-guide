<h3><a NAME="6_2_1">4.2.1. Overview</a></h3>
<p><em> Ratpoison</em> is a tiling window manager, somewhat like<em>
 xmonad</em> or<em> spectrwm</em>. Its two main features are that
 applications fill the whole screen, with no bars or buttons, and the
 user interface can be controlled entirely from the keyboard, with no
 mouse. If needed, any number of windows may be shown simultaneously and
 rearranged at will - hence the term &quot;tiling&quot; WM. All this may take some
 getting used to, but although - or perhaps because - the interface is
 so very different from the conventional point-and-click approach, it
 can quickly become highly intuitive. Learning which actual keys do what
 takes far less time than might be imagined. Apart from its efficiency
 and lack of clutter, Ratpoison is a good choice for anyone concerned
 about RSI (cumulative strain from long-term mouse use), or for netbook
 users, because &quot;every pixel counts&quot;. It is also highly configurable -
 and fast!</p>
<p> The applications present for the Ratpoison edition aim to fit in
 with its minimalist (but not spartan) approach. The majority use
 vim-style keybindings, even though Ratpoison itself does not, so users
 will need to become comfortable with these if they are not already;
 cheat sheets are available online to help assimilate them, as well as
 guides (and manpages) for the individual applications. Common
 operations use only a small subset of keys, which makes the learning
 curve smoother: for basic browsing, for instance, all you need to get
 started is page and history navigation and to know how to open links
 and tabs or windows. Other functions can be learned by exploration at
 your own pace. To begin using Vim itself, try running <code>vimtutor</code>
 from a terminal, and just follow the instructions.</p>
