<h3><a NAME="6_2_2">4.2.2. Starting Ratpoison and running applications</a>
</h3>
<p> When you boot Salix Ratpoison, there is no graphical login screen:
 when you log in, you enter the Linux terminal. Log in as your normal
 user and type</p>
<pre>
startx
</pre>
<p> to start Ratpoison itself.</p>
<p> You should then see the Salix wallpaper, and a message will appear
 briefly telling you how to view a list of commands. Type <code>Ctrl-t</code>
 (<code>C-t</code>, in Ratpoison's own notation) then a question mark;
 pressing any key takes you back to where you were before. There is
 nothing to see (apart from the beautiful Salix wallpaper)! But it's
 just as easy to set Ratpoison to work as with any more conventional
 desktop.</p>
<p> To select an application from the menu, type <code>C-t r</code>, and
 use the arrow keys to navigate (Vim's <code>hjkl</code> keys also
 work). Right arrow (or <code>l</code>) accesses submenus (such as
 &quot;Network&quot;) and left arrow (or <code>h</code>) goes back up a level.
 Right arrow or enter runs the application (if you open one by mistake,
 don't worry, just type <code>C-t r</code> again - we will see how to
 close windows and applications later).</p>

</p>
<p> Some common options are available directly at the top. The<em>
 Vimprobable2</em> browser, for instance, can be found under Network but
 also by just selecting &quot;Browser&quot;. Remember to use the keyboard and not
 the mouse! A third way to open it bypasses the menu altogether:</p>
<pre>
C-t v
</pre>
<p> You can create more shortcuts like this for applications you use a
 lot by adding them to the configuration file, which we will look at
 below.</p>
<p><em> apvlv</em>, under Accessories, can be used to read pdf documents
 such as this guide. Also under accessories, &quot;Unit conversion&quot; starts
 the console application units, which will convert between a large range
 of scales, such as time, weight, or currency, including some quite
 unusual ones.</p>
