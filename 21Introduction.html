<h3><a NAME="3_1_3">1.0.3. Installation Modes</a></h3>
<p> Salix offers three software installation options:<strong> Full</strong>
,<strong> Basic</strong> and<strong> Core</strong>, to meet your
 demands!</p>
<p> Performing a<strong> Full</strong> mode installation is the
 recommended way of installing Salix for most users. It includes a fully
 configured desktop environment with a complete selection of
 applications to fit the needs of most people, including office related
 software, multimedia applications, internet applications, all the Salix
 system configuration tools and more. Don't let the word &quot;Full&quot; fool
 you, this is in no way a bloated installation since it adheres to the
 &quot;one application per task&quot; rationale. We feel that the collection of
 software that accompanies each respective desktop environment will
 cover most user's needs but, of course, any user can tailor the
 software selection through the Salix package management tools as
 required.</p>
<p> A<strong> Basic</strong> mode installation is mostly targeted at
 advanced users. It includes the respective desktop environment of each
 edition, and a very minimal selection of software on top, namely the
 Salix system configuration tools and a web browser. Wi-fi connection
 tools or drivers are not present and only wired network connections are
 supported out of the box. The user is expected to know how to install
 extra software and tailor the installation to his/her needs.</p>
<p> A<strong> Core</strong> mode installation does not provide any
 graphical environment. It only installs a command line system,
 including the Salix command line system and package management tools.
 It is intended for expert users who know how to use the command line
 tools to administer their systems. It is most commonly used to set up
 types of server such as web-servers and e-mail servers. The servers
 that host the Salix websites are hosted on, run Salix installed using
 the<strong> Core</strong> mode method. Expert users can of course use
 this mode to install the X window system and any graphical environment
 on top of it if desired.</p>
