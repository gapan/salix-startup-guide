<H3><A NAME="3_2_2">2.2.2. Partition Management</A></H3>
<P> Before installing Salix, you need to have the necessary partition
 space available on your system, and if the computer does not have a
 separate partition for Linux, you must create one before installing
 Salix.</P>
<P> If you have an unformatted partition, unallocated disk space, an
 existing partition you do not use, or you are happy to completely erase
 and reformat your hard drive, you can create or rewrite a new partition
 table using<I> cfdisk</I> (or<I> cgdisk</I> for EFI systems), which is
 available through the Salix installer. A short <A HREF="#cfdisk">
tutorial</A> on using cfdisk is available in a later section in this
 guide.<I> cfdisk</I> and<I> cgdisk</I> are capable of removing and
 creating partitions, but they lack the functionality to resize
 partitions. While using<I> cfdisk</I> or<I> cgdisk</I> is easy, less
 experienced users may prefer the safeguards and graphical interface of<I>
 Gparted</I>, which can also resize and move partitions.</P>
<P> <IMG ALIGN="middle" ALT="" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="412" SRC="gparted.png" WIDTH="600">
</P>
<P> Live CDs from pretty much any Linux distribution come with <A HREF="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/docs/help-manual/C/gparted_manual.html">
Gparted</A>, which will enable you to change the partition organisation
 on a disk device while preserving the contents of the partitions. You
 may wish to use this application to create/re-organise your partition
 table.</P>
<P> A hard drive space can be divided into no more than four &quot;primary&quot;
 partitions, which can be problematic if you are hosting more than one
 operating system on the same hard drive. A hard drive can, however, be
 divided into three &quot;primary&quot; partitions and one &quot;extended&quot; partition.
 The extended partition can then be subdivided into &quot;logical&quot; partitions
 and hence overcome the limitation set by the &quot;primary partition&quot; (i.e.
 no more than four partitions). In practice, there is no difference
 between a logical and a primary partition except that &quot;Windows&quot; OS
 cannot be installed on a logical partition.</P>
<P> <div class="warning"><div class="admonition_header"><h2>Backup your files!</h2></div><div class="admonition"><div class="para"> It is advisable to back
 up any important files before modifying the partition table. </div></div></div></P>
<H4>2.2.2.1. So what kind of partitions do you need?</H4>
<UL>
<LI>Salix needs, at the very minimum, one partition which holds the root
 directory and must be assigned as <CODE>/</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>It is often recommended to have one swap partition though modern RAM
 sizes now often mean it isn't needed. If you already have another Linux
 OS running on your machine, its swap partition can be shared, and you
 do not need to create another. A swap partition is in essence used as
 extra RAM to improve the performance of your machine when, for example,
 your machine doesn't have a lot of physical RAM or you're performing
 memory-intensive operations (such as video editing) that use up most or
 all of the physical RAM. It is normally recommended to have 1.5-2 times
 the size of your RAM as swap space, but for a modern desktop computer
 with several GB of RAM, a swap partition may not be strictly necessary.</LI>
<LI>Many users like to have a separate partition to hold the /home
 directory, where you can store all your personal data such as
 documents, photos, customised settings for the desktop environment etc;
 but this is by no means necessary.</LI>
<LI>Optionally you can create separate partitions to hold different
 directories such as the /var directory, where system log files are
 stored. But unless you are running a server machine, this is probably
 unnecessary. An advantage of having more than one partition to hold
 separate directories is that you can reformat one partition without
 affecting others. For example, you can re-install Salix on your machine
 (this goes to the partition holding the &quot;/&quot; directory) while leaving
 the partition holding the /home directory intact; however, be aware
 that /home can contain configuration specific to each distribution and
 release, so sharing it between distros or reusing it when installing a
 new version of Salix is liable to lead to problems.</LI>
</UL>
<P> Each partition can be formatted into one of several file systems,
 including xfs, ext4, ext3, ext2, btrfs, jfs and reiserfs. The default
 is xfs.</P>
<P> <div class="important"><div class="admonition_header"><h2>EFI</h2></div><div class="admonition"><div class="para"> On (U)EFI systems, it is mandatory
 to have a separate partition allocated for<B> /boot</B>. This partition
 should have a type of<B> ef00</B>, when created in cgdisk. This
 partition should be formatted using the<B> FAT32</B> filesystem.
