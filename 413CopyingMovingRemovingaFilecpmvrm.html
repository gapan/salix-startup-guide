<H3><A NAME="5_1_3">4.1.3. Copying &amp; Moving &amp; Removing a File - cp &amp; mv
 &amp; rm</A></H3>
<P> <CODE>cp</CODE> is perhaps one of the most used commands in a
 console mode. <CODE>cp</CODE> copies a file or files from one location
 to another. Since we created the file called <CODE>log</CODE> and it is
 currently in the wrong directory, let us move it inside the <CODE>photo</CODE>
 directory. You can do so by issuing <CODE>cp log photo/</CODE> but
 perhaps it is better to call the log file not just <CODE>log</CODE> but
 <CODE>log.txt</CODE>, so that it would be obvious to a Windows user
 that it is a text file. Type in</P>
<PRE>
  cp log photo/log.txt
</PRE>
<P> and enter to execute the command.</P>
<P> You can go inside the <CODE>photo</CODE> directory and check if the
 copying has been done properly. <CODE>cd photo</CODE> and then <CODE>ls</CODE>
. The file should be there. Let's add to the log file by saying that it
 has been moved from <CODE>Music</CODE> to <CODE>photo</CODE>. Issuing</P>
<PRE>
  nano log.txt
</PRE>
<P> will bring up the text. Add a line to say it has been moved, and
 then save and quit the application by <CODE>Ctrl+x</CODE>.</P>
<P> Oh, but we forgot to delete the original <CODE>log</CODE> file in
 the <CODE>Music</CODE> folder. Let's just get back to the <CODE>Music</CODE>
 directory using <CODE>cd ..</CODE> and remove the <CODE>log</CODE> file
 by issuing <CODE>rm log</CODE>. The <CODE>rm</CODE> command removes a
 file or files. For example, if you would like to remove all photos with
 .jpg extension but not with .png, you can issue a command something
 like:</P>
<PRE>
  rm *.jpg
</PRE>
<P> This will remove all the files with .jpg extension within the
 directory you are in. Note that the <CODE>rm</CODE> command will not
 ask you to confirm your order. It will just carry out your instructions
 without further ado and once a file is removed, it is deleted forever.
 You cannot recover it from the recycle bin.</P>
<P> In this example, we used <CODE>cp</CODE> to copy the log file and
 then later on deleted it. Normally, this would be done by issuing a <CODE>
mv</CODE> command;</P>
<PRE>
  mv log photo/
</PRE>
<P> You can also use the <CODE>mv</CODE> command to rename a file. Let's
 say that you did not like the earlier decision to call the log file <CODE>
log.txt</CODE> and you now want to rename it as <CODE>log</CODE> again.
 Type in</P>
<PRE>
  mv photo/log.txt photo/log
</PRE>
<P> and execute the command. Now the file name has been changed back to <CODE>
log</CODE>.</P>
