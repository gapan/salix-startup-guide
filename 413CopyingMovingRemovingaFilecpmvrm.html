<h3><a NAME="5_1_3">4.1.3. Copying &amp; Moving &amp; Removing a File - cp &amp; mv
 &amp; rm</a></h3>
<p> <code>cp</code> is perhaps one of the most used commands in a
 console mode. <code>cp</code> copies a file or files from one location
 to another. Since we created the file called <code>log</code> and it is
 currently in the wrong directory, let us move it inside the <code>photo</code>
 directory. You can do so by issuing <code>cp log photo/</code> but
 perhaps it is better to call the log file not just <code>log</code> but
 <code>log.txt</code>, so that it would be obvious to a Windows user
 that it is a text file. Type in</p>
<pre>
  cp log photo/log.txt
</pre>
<p> and enter to execute the command.</p>
<p> You can go inside the <code>photo</code> directory and check if the
 copying has been done properly. <code>cd photo</code> and then <code>ls</code>
. The file should be there. Let's add to the log file by saying that it
 has been moved from <code>Music</code> to <code>photo</code>. Issuing</p>
<pre>
  nano log.txt
</pre>
<p> will bring up the text. Add a line to say it has been moved, and
 then save and quit the application by <code>Ctrl+x</code>.</p>
<p> Oh, but we forgot to delete the original <code>log</code> file in
 the <code>Music</code> folder. Let's just get back to the <code>Music</code>
 directory using <code>cd ..</code> and remove the <code>log</code> file
 by issuing <code>rm log</code>. The <code>rm</code> command removes a
 file or files. For example, if you would like to remove all photos with
 .jpg extension but not with .png, you can issue a command something
 like:</p>
<pre>
  rm *.jpg
</pre>
<p> This will remove all the files with .jpg extension within the
 directory you are in. Note that the <code>rm</code> command will not
 ask you to confirm your order. It will just carry out your instructions
 without further ado and once a file is removed, it is deleted forever.
 You cannot recover it from the recycle bin.</p>
<p> In this example, we used <code>cp</code> to copy the log file and
 then later on deleted it. Normally, this would be done by issuing a <code>
mv</code> command;</p>
<pre>
  mv log photo/
</pre>
<p> You can also use the <code>mv</code> command to rename a file. Let's
 say that you did not like the earlier decision to call the log file <code>
log.txt</code> and you now want to rename it as <code>log</code> again.
 Type in</p>
<pre>
  mv photo/log.txt photo/log
</pre>
<p> and execute the command. Now the file name has been changed back to <code>
log</code>.</p>
