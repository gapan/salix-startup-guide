<h3><a NAME="5_1_5">4.1.5. Installing a Program - slapt-get</a></h3>
<p> Maybe a little bird has told you that there is a wonderful
 application called<i> cowsay</i> in Linux, and now you would like to
 see what this program can do.</p>
<p> If this is the first time you are installing an application on
 Salix, the first thing you should do is to update the package database
 on your computer by executing</p>
<pre>
  sudo slapt-get -u 
</pre>
<p> Then to search for an application (in this case, &quot;cowsay&quot;), type in</p>
<pre>
  slapt-get --search cowsay
</pre>
<p> Notice that you don't need to type <code>sudo</code> just for
 searching for a package. The output you will get should be similar to
 this:</p>
<pre>
  george[~]$ slapt-get --search cowsay
  cowsay-3.03-noarch-1salix15.0 [inst=no]: cowsay (A Configurable Speaking/Thinking Cow)
  xcowsay-1.5.1-x86_64-2salix15.0 [inst=no]: xcowsay (display a cute cow and speech bubble)
</pre>
<p> To install it, you simply must run:</p>
<pre>
  sudo slapt-get -i cowsay
</pre>
<p> If you are not sure what this <code>-i</code> is in the above
 command, you can check it with <code>slapt-get --help</code>. You will
 see a lot of lines running up the terminal quickly until the
 application is installed.</p>
<p> Once it is installed, you might want to test it. First get out of
 the superuser mode by typing <code>exit</code>. Then type in <code>
cowsay</code>. Nothing happens, and, in fact, you will see that you are
 now in a strange mode that you cannot execute any commands. This is
 because the application is still running, but as you don't see
 anything, perhaps it is not running properly. To terminate the process,
 press <code>Ctrl+c</code>. You will get back the normal input line back
 on your terminal.</p>
<pre>
  george[Desktop]$ cowsay
  ^C
  george[Desktop]$
</pre>
<p> So what was going wrong? Check</p>
<pre>
  cowsay -h
</pre>
<p> You will see that you need to type in a <code>[message]</code>. Try
 again with</p>
<pre>
  cowsay Hello Salix!
</pre>
<p> We have merely scratched the surface of the power of the command
 line here. The best way to learn more is by using it, but remember to
 use the help tools, and consult online documentation such as that
 listed in the Salix forum. <a HREF="http://linuxcommand.org/index.php">
Linuxcommand.org</a> can be particularly recommended if you wish to gain
 a comprehensive grounding. Proceed cautiously, but don't be afraid to
 experiment.</p>
<p> A final tip - it can be difficult to copy longer commands
 accurately. If you select the text with the mouse, clicking the middle
 button or wheel will paste it accurately into the command line or
 wherever you wish. This only works in a terminal running within a GUI.</p>
