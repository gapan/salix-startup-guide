<h3><a NAME="6_2_6">4.2.6. Editing the configuration file</a></h3>
<p> After using<em> Alpine</em> a little, one problem may become
 apparent. Its shortcut for selecting a file, for example to attach it,
 is <code>C-t</code>. But that's Ratpoison's escape key combination! In
 fact, Ratpoison has a solution for such conflicts, referred to somewhat
 cryptically in the shortcut list as<em> meta</em>: <code>C-t t</code>
 should send <code>C-t</code> to the application in the active window.
 However, this does not work in the terminal, which does not recognize
 the character if it receives it in this form.</p>
<p> Everything in Ratpoison is configurable, and the <code>C-t</code>
 combination itself is no exception. A temporary solution is to reassign
 the binding using Ratpoison's command input feature. <code>C-t :</code>
 conjures up an input line at the top right of the screen. This can be
 used for passing instructions to Ratpoison. For instance, one way of
 opening an application in a new console is:</p>
<pre>
C-t :exec xterm -e alpine
</pre>
<p> which starts the program we just installed. The colon command can be
 used to pass a number of instructions to Ratpoison; see</p>
<pre>
man ratpoison
</pre>
<p> for a full list together with shortcuts where they have been
 defined. In fact, there is a shortcut for <code>exec</code>. Just type</p>
<pre>
C-t ! [application]
</pre>
<p> <code>C-t C-!</code> opens it in a console.</p>
<p> To change the <code>C-t</code> default, do: <code>C-t :escape
 Super_L</code>, which is the so-called &quot;Windows key&quot; to the left of the
 keyboard. As well as resolving the conflict with<em> Alpine</em>, this
 has the great benefit of being just one keystroke. Some functions may
 not work correctly, in particular, the very useful <code>C-t C-t</code>
 to go back to where you just were, and performance varies from one
 keyboard to another, so it's worth experimenting. Another possibility
 is the &quot;Menu&quot; key. To return to the default: <code>C-t :escape C-t</code>
.</p>
<p> To make such a change permanent, edit<em> ~/.ratpoisonrc</em>. If
 you are using Ratpoison, you can open the file now (with<em> GVim</em>
 or<em> Vim</em>) and tile it horizontally with the window where you are
 reading this guide (<code>C-t Shift-s</code>). Let's go through some
 items in the file.</p>
<pre>
# .ratpoisonrc

banish
% !! there is no such application in the repositories

set border 0
set barpadding 0 0
set font terminus
set winfmt %n%s%a

bind W exec rpallwin
bind r exec ~/.ratmenu/main.sh

bind F1 exec rpws move1
bind F2 exec rpws move2
bind F3 exec rpws move3
bind F4 exec rpws move4
bind F5 exec rpws move5
bind F11 exec rpws moveprev
bind F12 exec rpws movenext

bind v exec vimprobable2

# set default background
%this will need updating
exec feh --bg-scale /usr/share/xfce4/backdrops/StairWay.png

# create 5 workspaces and create aliases (run: rpws help)
exec rpws init 5 -k

</pre>
<p><em> banish</em> sends the mouse pointer to bottom right
 (incidentally, you may wish to install<em> unclutter</em>, which makes
 it fade out altogether after a few seconds of stillness; place the line</p>
<pre>
unclutter &amp;
</pre>
<p> in your<em> ~/.xinitrc</em> to run it automatically when X is
 started). We've seen all but one of the custom keybindings in the
 &quot;bind&quot; statements. To change the wallpaper, point to a different image.
 The final item sets up workspaces, which we'll look at next - including
 <code>C-t W</code>.</p>
<p> Before editing the file, create a backup copy in case anything goes
 wrong. To change the <code>C-t</code> default, simply add a line:</p>
<pre>
escape Menu
</pre>
<p> We've seen many of the custom keybindings in the &quot;bind&quot; statements.</p>
<p> The final item, together with the bindings to function keys, sets up
 workspaces; we'll look at these next - including <code>C-t W</code>.</p>
