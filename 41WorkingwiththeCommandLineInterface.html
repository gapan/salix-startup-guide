<H2 ID="working_with_cli"><A NAME="5_1">4.1. Working with the Command
 Line Interface</A></H2>
<P> This section deals with working in a console mode or with a terminal
 (such as Xfce terminal, xterm, konsole and so forth), and serves merely
 as a light introduction to the command line interface (CLI). The
 intended audience here is not seasoned travelers but new journeymen in
 the land of Linux, who are willing to discover more about what one can
 do with it. We will go through some examples in this section for you to
 follow, and hopefully by the end of this walkthrough, you will have no
 problem working with the &quot;black screen&quot;. For those who would like to
 know more about CLI, there are a couple of useful resources available
 on the net, and some are listed in the <A HREF="http://forum.salixos.org">
Salix Forum</A>.</P>
<P> So why learn CLI commands at all? Graphical user interfaces for
 applications have been steadily improving in Linux and are probably now
 comparable to any OS in their ease of use. On the other hand, where
 Linux excels, in particular, is in the area of command line
 applications, its traditional strength. Without the CLI, you would be
 effectively missing out on half of what Linux can offer.</P>
<P> There is another reason. From time to time, you might have to work
 in the console. For instance, if the machine fails to start up a
 graphical desktop environment during booting, then you are more or less
 forced to fix the problem without the graphical user interface (GUI).</P>
<P> Of course, there are many other reasons to learn CLI commands, but
 for now we will start by learning how to move around directories.</P>
<P> First, open up a terminal or move to a console: you can do the
 latter by pressing<B> Ctrl+Alt+F2</B>, for example. To get back to the
 graphical desktop, press<B> Alt+F4</B>, for example. F number keys are
 used to switch between consoles; if F4 or F7 doesn't do the trick, try
 others.</P>
<P> However, the simplest option is to open a terminal within the GUI:
 there is probably an option to do so in the panel, or if not, in the
 menu.</P>
