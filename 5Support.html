<p> If you are still quite new to either Salix, Slackware or even Linux
 in general, then you should first of all take some time to study Salix
 Startup Guide, as it is specifically intended to be accessible to
 newcomers. The desktop link, Salix Online, will bring you to the Salix <a
HREF="http://www.salixos.org">Homepage</a>. You could also use the <a HREF="https://web.libera.chat/#salix">
IRC link</a> to be in live communication with members of the community
 and get instant help if necessary. If you do, however, you might want
 to modify the default<i> GuestXX</i> login to something more personal.</p>
<p> <img ALIGN="middle" ALT="" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="251" SRC="salix-online.png"
WIDTH="150"></p>
<p> We hope that the information here will allow you to get Salix up and
 running fairly straightforwardly, to begin exploring its potential,
 and, above all, to use it for what you want to do. Nonetheless,
 sometimes you may not know how to do something or be able to make it
 work.</p>
<p> While Salix aims to be elegant and intuitive, every operating system
 has its own characteristics, and if you are new to Linux, the sheer
 fact that it is different means there will inevitably be a process of
 adaptation (see Linux is <a HREF="http://linux.oneandoneis2.org/LNW.htm">
Not Windows</a>), even where its very best features are concerned. The
 only way to climb the learning curve is by trying things out and using
 them. The more you explore Salix, the quicker you will become familiar
 with it. However, it is worth emphasising that the default set of
 applications (they vary depending on the version of Salix you choose,
 see <a HREF="#list_of_applications">List of Applications</a>) include
 many that have a very similar look and feel to those found on other
 operating systems, such as the office suite LibreOffice, which offers
 full compatibility with common file formats.</p>
<p> Our <a HREF="http://docs.salixos.org">Wiki</a> and <a HREF="http://forum.salixos.org">
Forum</a> will be two other important sources of information. The search
 option of the forum will quickly show you if the question you have in
 mind has already been posted by a member of the community and if it has
 been answered. For the same reason, please also search the internet. If
 you are working on the command line (<a HREF="#working_with_cli">
Working with the Command Line Interface</a>), remember to consult <code>
man</code> (and try <code>man salix</code> for a summary of key points
 specific to this distribution). There are several online forums devoted
 to Linux, such as <a HREF="http://www.linuxquestions.org/">
linuxquestions.org</a>. It should be noted that each forum has its own
 subculture, and sometimes explicit posting guidelines. If you post a
 query to a forum, bear <a HREF="http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/dravling/grice.html">
Paul Grice's conversational maxims</a> in mind: for instance, be as
 specific as possible and mention any information you have already found
 out. To put it another way, remember you are consulting a human
 community, not an interactive online encyclopedia; it is a
 conversation, something which can be easily lost sight of online.</p>
<p> Forums are a concrete example of one of the qualities at the heart
 of Linux, which is that it is community-based. Rather than being a
 commercial product, in almost all cases it is developed by enthusiasts
 collaborating together for the sheer delight of making good software.
 This community extends out into the users of the distribution on its
 forums. Even if you just want to use core office, multimedia or network
 applications productively, over time the power that Linux gives users
 tends to promote self-reliance and an ability to configure and fix
 their computer setup independently. The same approach underlies the
 development of Linux as an operating system; where there is room for
 improvement, someone will dive in and tinker. The cumulative result is
 that Linux today is highly usable out of the box.</p>
<p> The best way to learn Linux is by using it to the full, finding out
 in the process how to make it do exactly what you want. After a while,
 though, it may be helpful to supplement this experience with some more
 systematic background. As mentioned in the section introducing the
 command line, the <a HREF="http://www.salixos.org/forum/viewforum.php?f=30&amp;sid=8007ff0fe74d8ba139ecb29032db24d2">
Documentation</a> board on the Salix forums contains a useful post on <a HREF="http://www.salixos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=30&amp;t=852">
tutorials and guides</a>. Wherever you find problems recur, it may be
 worth reading up on the underlying issues over time to gain broader
 knowledge, especially when it comes to general features of Linux that
 may be unfamiliar to you, such as file permissions.</p>
<p> Some users may face problems at the very beginning with peripherals
 or the network. This can seem daunting if you are also adapting to a
 different operating system at the same time. Explore the options under
 Menu/System carefully. If difficulties persist, with judicious use of
 the information and help in the wiki and forums, you should hopefully
 get the essentials set up as you wish reasonably quickly; then you will
 be able to take Linux at your own pace.</p>
