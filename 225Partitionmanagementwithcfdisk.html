<H3 ID="cfdisk"><A NAME="3_2_5">2.2.5. Partition management with cfdisk</A>
</H3>
<P> These instructions assume that you will create a single partition to
 hold Salix, plus a swap partition, as an illustration; however,<I>
 cfdisk</I> can create any partitioning scheme required. Note that you
 can also delete partitions (which will irrevocably destroy their
 contents). New partitions can be created in free space. For the
 purposes of this example, it is assumed the entire disk is free. Swap,
 if you need it, should normally be twice your RAM, so if that is 250
 MB, swap should be 500 MB. If you have more than 2 GB of RAM, you
 needn't take this rule too strictly and you can have smaller sized swap
 partitions.</P>
<P> You can move between the commands listed at the bottom of the screen
 with the arrow keys, or select the command by typing the first letter,
 such as 'Q' to<B> Quit</B>.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Make a<B> New</B> partition, taking up all but 1 GB of the disk
 (this will be used for swap space). Note that you can choose whether to
 create a Primary or Extended partition; the former is what is needed in
 this example, but an extended partition will allow for the creation of
 logical partitions within it, when a more complex setup is needed.</LI>
<LI>Make this partition<B> Bootable</B> (with 'B'). Use the up and down
 arrow keys to select a particular partition, if there is more than one.
 The default partition type is 'Linux' so that partition is done.</LI>
<LI>Next, make another new partition, taking up the rest of the drive.</LI>
<LI>Change its<B> Type</B> to 82, Linux Swap.</LI>
<LI>When you are happy with it,<B> Write</B> the partition table to
 disk.</LI>
<LI><B>Quit</B> to continue with Salix installation.</LI>

<P> <div class="note"><div class="admonition_header"><h2>GPT</h2></div><div class="admonition"><div class="para"> If your hard drive is partitioned using the
 GPT scheme, instead of the older MBR scheme, instead of cfdisk, you get
 cgdisk. While there are some differences between them, you'll find out
 that they are mostly the same, so the instructions provided for cfdisk
 apply to cgdisk, for the most part. </div></div></div></P>
<H4>2.2.5.1. cfdisk usage details</H4>
<H5>2.2.5.1.1. Hard disk names</H5>
<P> SCSI harddisks are named with<I> sdx</I>, where<I> x</I> is a
 harddisk letter. The disk with the lowest SCSI ID on the first
 controller will become<I> sda</I>, the next after that, sdb, and so on.</P>
<H5>2.2.5.1.2. Hard disk partitions</H5>
<P> GNU/Linux systems often use a partition scheme inherited from
 MS-DOS. With this, a harddisk can have up to four primary partitions.
 If you want more, you have to make one of these an extended partition
 where you can make several logical partitions. The partitions are named
 with the disk they belong to, and a number. The first primary partition
 on the first disk is therefore<I> sda1</I>, the second primary
 partition is<I> sda2</I>, and so on. The first and second logical
 partition on an extended partition on the first disk is<I> sda5</I> and<I>
 sda6</I>, and so on.</P>
<H4>2.2.5.2. Using cfdisk</H4>
<H5>2.2.5.2.1. The user interface</H5>
<P> After<I> cfdisk</I> is started you'll get an interface where the
 current partition table is listed with the names and some data about
 each partition and some command buttons on the bottom of the screen. To
 change between partitions, use the up and down arrow keys. To change
 between commands, use the left and right arrow keys.</P>
<H5>2.2.5.2.2. Deleting a partition</H5>
<P> To delete an existing partition, highlight it with the up and down
 keys, select the Delete command with the left and right arrow keys and
 press<I> Enter</I> or just press <CODE>D</CODE>.</P>
<H5>2.2.5.2.3. Making a new partition</H5>
<P> To make a new partition, select the New command with the left and
 right arrow keys, and press<I> Enter</I>. You'll get the choice between
 a primary and a logical partition. If you want a logical partition, the
 program will automatically make an extended partition for you. Then you
 must choose the size of the partition (in MB). If you can't enter a
 value in MB, return to the main screen with the <CODE>Esc</CODE> key
 and select MB with the Units command.</P>
<H5>2.2.5.2.4. Set the type of a partition</H5>
<P> To set the type of a partition, highlight the desired partition and
 select the<I> Type</I> command. You'll get a list of different types.
 Press<I> space</I>, and you'll get even more. Find what type you need,
 and enter the number at the prompt. Linux is <CODE>83</CODE>, Linux
 swap is <CODE>82</CODE>.</P>
<H5>2.2.5.2.5. Make a partition bootable</H5>
<P> To be able to boot from a primary partition, you need to make it
 bootable. Highlight the partition and select the<I> Bootable</I>
 command.</P>
<H5>2.2.5.2.6. Write the result to disk and quit</H5>
<P> When you are content with the layout of the disk, select the<I>
 Write</I> command. The partition table will be written to disk.
 Remember that this will destroy all data on partitions you have deleted
 or changed. You should, therefore, be very sure that you want to do
 this before actually pressing the Return key.</P>
<P> To exit the program, select the<I> Quit</I> command. The installer
 will then detect any partitions you have created and offer you the
 option to assign mount points to them.</P>
