<H2><A NAME="4_1">3.1. Package Management</A></H2>
<P> Installing applications (which roughly equates to &quot;installing
 packages&quot;) is a fundamental part of the Linux experience. A Linux
 distribution, such as Salix (or Slackware, on which it is based) could
 be said to consist of its repositories, where the software available
 for that distribution is kept. These packages have been compiled with
 the kernel and build tools provided by the distribution and tested to
 ensure they work together. Salix, like most distros (but not Slackware)
 provides full dependency management, which means that any items the
 package needs to run are installed too -- and also that they are
 guaranteed to be available.</P>
<P> <A HREF="http://slackbuilds.org">slackbuilds.org</A> (SBo) provides
 build scripts for further software not present in the repositories.
 This means the package will be built on your system before being
 installed. Salix provides a graphical tool,<I> Sourcery</I>, to manage
 this; its command-line equivalent is<I> slapt-src</I>. Both do have
 limited dependency management, but the build is not guaranteed to be
 successful and some manual tinkering may be needed.</P>
<P> Unlike the software provided in the repositories, these scripts are
 not maintained by either Salix or Slackware but by individual users,
 and as such are not the responsibility of either distribution, although
 help may be found on the forum. If the build fails, the last ten lines
 or so of the output usually provide an indication of the reason. Most
 commonly, this is a missing dependency, which may be a build dependency
 (needed to compile the package, but not to run it). Common packages
 that are required by several SlackBuilds, but not included as part of a
 standard Salix installation are<I> cmake</I> and<I> linuxdoc-tools</I>,
 so first make sure you have these installed if you encounter any
 problems.</P>
<P> If you don't mind using a bit of extra space on your hard drive,
 then most of these problems could disappear by installing the<I>
 slackware/d</I> and<I> slackware/l</I> package sets:</P>
<PRE>
  sudo slapt-get --install-set slackware/d --install-set slackware/l
</PRE>
<P> You can also create and install your own packages, for which Salix
 provides a suite of console scripts, especially <CODE>slkbuild</CODE>;
 for further information, see the wiki pages on packaging. When
 installing packages from any other source, proceed with caution.</P>
<P> In a nutshell, the first place to look for an application you'd like
 to use is the Salix repositories, which also access the core of
 Slackware packages around which Salix is built (<I>Gslapt</I>,<I>
 slapt-get</I>); second port of call should generally be the slackbuild
 repo (<I>Sourcery</I>,<I> slapt-src</I>). It is not recommended
 (especially for beginners) to reconfigure the package management tools
 to access any other repositories. Should you wish to install any such
 package, it is probably best to download it individually and install
 manually (for instance with<I> pkgtool</I> or <A HREF="#spkg">spkg</A>
). Finally, you can <A HREF="#roll-your-own">make your own package</A>.</P>
<P> Note that<I> twapake</I> is a useful tool available from the
 repositories to keep track of installed packages, from whatever source.</P>

 privileges in order to install or upgrade packages. </div></div></div></P>
