<h2><a NAME="4_1">3.1. Package Management</a></h2>
<p> Installing applications (which roughly equates to &quot;installing
 packages&quot;) is a fundamental part of the Linux experience. A Linux
 distribution, such as Salix (or Slackware, on which it is based) could
 be said to consist of its repositories, where the software available
 for that distribution is kept. These packages have been compiled with
 the kernel and build tools provided by the distribution and tested to
 ensure they work together. Salix, like most distros (but not Slackware)
 provides full dependency management, which means that any items the
 package needs to run are installed too -- and also that they are
 guaranteed to be available.</p>
<p> Installing extra software is also possible through flatpaks and <a HREF="https://flathub.org">
Flathub</a>. Just navigate to the software you wish to install and press
 the &quot;Install&quot; button on the webpage. If your browser defaults to
 downloading the <code>.flatpakref</code> file instead of opening it,
 just open the Downloads folder and double-click it inside your file
 manager.</p>
<p> You can also create and install your own packages, for which Salix
 provides a suite of console scripts, especially <code>slkbuild</code>;
 for further information, see the wiki pages on packaging. When
 installing packages from any other source, proceed with caution.</p>
<p> <a HREF="http://slackbuilds.org">slackbuilds.org</a> (SBo) provides
 build scripts for further software not present in the repositories.
 This means the package will be built on your system before being
 installed. Salix provides a command-lie tool,<i> slapt-src</i>, for
 this purpose. But it has limited dependency management, as not
 dependencies are listed at SBo. Therefore the build is not guaranteed
 to be successful and some manual tinkering may be needed. Unlike the
 software provided in the repositories, these scripts are not maintained
 by either Salix or Slackware but by individual users, and as such are
 not the responsibility of either distribution, although help may be
 found on the forum. If the build fails, the last ten lines or so of the
 output usually provide an indication of the reason. Most commonly, this
 is a missing dependency, which may be a build dependency (needed to
 compile the package, but not to run it). Common packages that are
 required by several SlackBuilds, but not included as part of a standard
 Salix installation are<i> cmake</i> and<i> linuxdoc-tools</i>, so first
 make sure you have these installed if you encounter any problems. If
 you don't mind using a bit of extra space on your hard drive, then most
 of these problems could disappear by installing the<i> slackware/d</i>
 and<i> slackware/l</i> package sets:</p>
<pre>
  sudo slapt-get --install-set slackware/d --install-set slackware/l
</pre>
<p> However, you shouldn't really need to revert to SBo often, if at
 all. The Salix repositories offer thousands of packages and even more
 are available through <a HREF="https://flathub.org">Flathub</a>.</p>
