<H3><A NAME="5_2_1">4.2.1. Overview</A></H3>
<P><I> Ratpoison</I> is a tiling window manager, somewhat like<I> xmonad</I>
 or<I> spectrwm</I>. Its two main features are that applications fill
 the whole screen, with no bars or buttons, and the user interface can
 be controlled entirely from the keyboard, with no mouse. If needed, any
 number of windows may be shown simultaneously and rearranged at will -
 hence the term &quot;tiling&quot; WM. All this may take some getting used to, but
 although - or perhaps because - the interface is so very different from
 the conventional point-and-click approach, it can quickly become highly
 intuitive. Learning which actual keys do what takes far less time than
 might be imagined. Apart from its efficiency and lack of clutter,
 Ratpoison is a good choice for anyone concerned about RSI (cumulative
 strain from long-term mouse use), or for netbook users, because &quot;every
 pixel counts&quot;. It is also highly configurable - and fast!</P>
<P> The applications present for the Ratpoison edition aim to fit in
 with its minimalist (but not spartan) approach. The majority use
 vim-style keybindings, even though Ratpoison itself does not, so users
 will need to become comfortable with these if they are not already;
 cheat sheets are available online to help assimilate them, as well as
 guides (and manpages) for the individual applications. Common
 operations use only a small subset of keys, which makes the learning
 curve smoother: for basic browsing, for instance, all you need to get
 started is page and history navigation and to know how to open links
 and tabs or windows. Other functions can be learned by exploration at
 your own pace. To begin using Vim itself, try running <CODE>vimtutor</CODE>
 from a terminal, and just follow the instructions.</P>
