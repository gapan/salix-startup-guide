<H3><A NAME="2_1_2">1.0.3. Installation Modes</A></H3>
<P> Salix offers three software installation options:<B> Full</B>,<B>
 Basic</B> and<B> Core</B>, to meet your demands!</P>
<P> Performing a<B> Full</B> mode installation is the recommended way of
 installing Salix for most users. It includes a fully configured desktop
 environment with a complete selection of applications to fit the needs
 of most people, including office related software, multimedia
 applications, internet applications, all the Salix system configuration
 tools and more. Don't let the word &quot;Full&quot; fool you, this is in no way a
 bloated installation since it adheres to the &quot;one application per task&quot;
 rationale. We feel that the collection of software that accompanies
 each respective desktop environment will cover most user's needs but,
 of course, any user can tailor the software selection through the Salix
 package management tools as required.</P>
<P> A<B> Basic</B> mode installation is mostly targeted at advanced
 users. It includes the respective desktop environment of each edition,
 and a very minimal selection of software on top, namely the Salix
 system configuration tools and a web browser. Wi-fi connection tools or
 drivers are not present and only wired network connections are
 supported out of the box. The user is expected to know how to install
 extra software and tailor the installation to his/her needs.</P>
<P> A<B> Core</B> mode installation does not provide any graphical
 environment. It only installs a command line system, including the
 Salix command line system and package management tools. It is intended
 for expert users who know how to use the command line tools to
 administer their systems. It is most commonly used to set up types of
 server such as web-servers and e-mail servers. The servers that host
 the Salix websites are hosted on, run Salix installed using the<B> Core</B>
 mode method. Expert users can of course use this mode to install the X
 window system and any graphical environment on top of it if desired.</P>
