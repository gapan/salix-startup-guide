<h3><a NAME="3_2_3">2.2.3. Installing from a Salix Installation Disc</a></h3>
<p> Installing Salix from a Salix Installation optical disc is somewhat
 similar to installing Slackware, but the entire process is considerably
 shorter and less complicated. Everything is done efficiently in a
 semi-graphical command line interface.</p>
<p> To start the installation process, you may type <code>setup</code>
 (or press the up arrow on your keyboard to revoke the same command -
 useful if your actual keymap doesn't match the one that is used by
 default in the installer). Once the installer starts, you will be
 presented with several dialogs to customize the installation process.
 Here is what you will have to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select your keymap.</li>
<li>The installer will run<i> cfdisk</i> (or<i> cgdisk</i>) to allow you
 to set up your desired partitions. If they are already as you wish,
 type 'Q' to quit. See below for a detailed guide to using <a HREF="#cfdisk">
cfdisk</a>.</li>
<li>Your swap partition, if any, will be automatically detected. Say <code>
yes</code> if the detected partition corresponds to that.</li>
<li>You will then be asked to specify the partition for the root <code>/</code>
 directory. Select the partition you have created for the <code>/</code>
, and continue to format the partition. Unless you prefer otherwise, the
 xfs file system is recommended here.</li>
<li>If you have other partitions to mount, you can do so. If you have a
 partition for a <code>/home</code> directory, select the partition and
 continue. Unless the partition is new or you would like to erase the
 content of this partition, select not to format.</li>
<li>Other partitions such as Windows partitions will be detected
 automatically. If you would like to make those partitions automatically
 usable during your Salix session, include them all to mount.</li>
<li>The installer will start installing Salix. You will be asked first
 where the source files are. If you are installing from the CD, select
 &quot;from the CD&quot;. Everything should be detected automatically.</li>
<li>You will be asked to choose an installation mode (<b>Full</b>,<b>
 Basic</b> or<b> Core</b>).</li>
<li>Installation of packages will start.</li>
<li>After the installation, LILO (or eLILO for EUFI systems) setup will
 start up. Unless you are<b> not</b> using LILO/eLILO, choose the
 default options. You can refine the bootloader configuration (for
 example, in a multi-boot scenario) after booting into your new Salix
 installation.</li>
<li>You will be asked some other questions regarding time-zone, username
 and password. Make sure you add at least one user to your system,
 otherwise you will not be able to log in!</li>
<li>When all the basic questions are answered, you will be presented the
 option to reboot the system.</li>
<li>That's all. The computer is good to go! Enjoy Salix!</li>
</ul>
<p> <div class="note"><div class="admonition_header"><h2>Salix now uses sudo!</h2></div><div class="admonition"><div class="para"> By default, the first user
 created has access to sudo, any others do not; to allow them access as
 well, they need to be added to the wheel group. The<b> root</b> user is
 disabled by default in Salix. </div></div></div></p>
